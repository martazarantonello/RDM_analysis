## Data Setup

To use this tool, you need to download the incident data CSVs from Network Rail, SWR Passenger Loadings and NWR schedule data (or your organisation's portal).

1. Create a `data/` folder in the project root if it doesn't exist.
2. Download the following files and save them in `data/`:
   - `Transparency_23-24_P12.csv`
   - `Transparency_23-24_P13.csv`
   - `Transparency_24-25_P01.csv`
   - ...
   - `SWR Passenger Loadings - RY25 P10.xlsx`
   - `SWR Passenger Loadings - RY25 P11.xlsx`
   - ...
   - `toc-full.pkl` (for schedule data)
3. The tool will automatically detect and load these files from the `data/` folder.
